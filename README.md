### Linking Frontend and Backend

To ensure the frontend and backend communicate correctly:

    ```
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

2. In the backend, ensure CORS is configured to allow requests from the frontend. Update `server.js`:
    ```javascript
    const cors = require('cors');
    app.use(cors({
      origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
      credentials: true
    }));
    ```
